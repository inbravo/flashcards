Q1: When you launch an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, what does the instance type define?    
A: The amount of compute for an Amazon EC2 instance, including RAM, instance storage, CPU, and network bandwidth.  

---

Q2: When you launch an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, what is defined by the Amazon Machine Image (AMI)?  
A: The initial software state of the instance when launched, including operating system, configuration, and additional installed programs.

---

Q3: What is the drawback of Spot Instances?  
A: They can be terminated when the spot price goes above your current bid price.  

---

Q4: How does the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) ReservedInstance pricing model work?   
A: You pay up front to reserve compute for one or three years, locking in a lower cost in the process.  

---

Q5: What is the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) On Demand pricing model?    
A: You launch Amazon EC2 instances on request and pay the full hourly cost until you stop or terminate the instances. This is the most flexible and least cost-effective pricing model.  

---

Q6: How can you address an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance to connect over the Internet?    
A: By public IP address, elastic IP address, orDNS name. net?    

---

Q7: What is Enhanced Networking for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)?     
A: A setting to get higher packet per second, lower network jitter, and lower latencies.     

---

Q8: What type of block storage is provided at no additional charge with certain Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance types?      
A: Instance Store (or ephemeral storage).  

---

Q9: VM Import/Export allows you to import existing virtual machines from your local environmentand convert them to what?     
A: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances or Amazon Machine Images (AMIs).  

---

Q10: Which storage option continues to store data despite stopping and starting an instance?     
A: Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS).  

---

Q11: What are the four network capacity ratings for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance types?   
A: Low, moderate, high, and 10 Gbps.  

---

Q12: What is instance metadata?  
A: Data about an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance—such as instance ID, instance type, and security groups—that can be obtained via an HTTP call from within the instance.   

---

Q13: What are the four properties of a security group rule?  
A: Traffic direction, port, protocol, and destination (or source) address.  

---

Q14: When an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance is a member of two security groups, what resulting traffic flow is allowed?  
A: The rules from each security group are aggregated to create one set of permissive rules, so the result is a union of all traffic allowed by the rules in both security groups.   

---

Q15: Which Amazon Elastic Block Storage (Amazon EBS) volume type is the best choice for workloads such as large databases executing many transactions?   
A: Provisioned IOPS SSD.  

---

Q16: What Amazon Elastic Block Storage (Amazon EBS) volume type is appropriate for cold and infrequently accessed data?   
A: Magnetic volumes.  

---

Q17: Which Amazon Elastic Block Storage (Amazon EBS) volume type is appropriate for dev/test environments, small databases, and so forth?  
A:  General-purpose SSD.  

---

Q18: What must an application running on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance do differently to access data on an encrypted Amazon Elastic Block Storage (Amazon EBS) volume?  
A:  Nothing. Amazon EBS encryption is transparent to applications on the attached instances.
